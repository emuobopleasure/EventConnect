This project actually contains two projects:
- A React.js application (i.e., the frontend SPA)
- A dummy backend API to which the React app can "talk" (to send + fetch data)

You must run "npm install" in both project folders.

Thereafter, you can start the dummy backend API server via "npm start" (inside the "backend-api" folder).
The React app dev server is then also started via "npm start" (though inside the "react-frontend" folder).

You MUST have both servers (backend + frontend) up and running for the projects to work.

The dummy backend API does not use any external database - instead the dummy data is saved to an "events.json" file inside the project folder.

// Challenge / Exercise

// 1. Add five new (dummy) page components (content can be simple <h1> elements)
//    - HomePage
//    - EventsPage
//    - EventDetailPage
//    - NewEventPage
//    - EditEventPage
// 2. Add routing & route definitions for these five pages
//    - / => HomePage
//    - /events => EventsPage
//    - /events/<some-id> => EventDetailPage
//    - /events/new => NewEventPage
//    - /events/<some-id>/edit => EditEventPage
// 3. Add a root layout that adds the <MainNavigation> component above all page components
// 4. Add properly working links to the MainNavigation
// 5. Ensure that the links in MainNavigation receive an "active" class when active
// 6. Output a list of dummy events to the EventsPage
//    Every list item should include a link to the respective EventDetailPage
// 7. Output the ID of the selected event on the EventDetailPage
// BONUS: Add another (nested) layout route that adds the <EventNavigation> component above all /events... page components
